Where science fiction differs from fantasy is its heavy reliance on science at technology, both of which lay at the root of all science fiction stories. The worlds portrayed in science fiction stories are not made up of fantastical creatures, but rather of those created or discovered through science."

Historical fiction is often enriched by historically accurate details from the specific time period. The goal of historical fiction is to maintain authenticity around the time period, with a focus on accurately portraying customs, traditions, and events of the time. It is not uncommon in historical fiction for fictional characters to interact with real-life figures. One of the best examples of historical fiction is the wealth of World War II-era books that have been released in recent years."

Maidens are prepared for an important religious ritual, deeply revered and zealously guarded. Makivka, therefore, grew up in abundance but lacks personal freedom. She is bound by the rigid frames of rules, yet she clandestinely breaks them all: she learns martial arts, helps those less fortunate, secretly goes for walks in the city, and more. During one of these excursions, Makivka, disguised, encounters a handsome stranger. He mistakes her for a servant with whom he has an appointmentЧa diversion that Maidens could only dream of. Soon, this handsome stranger finds himself in the castle where Makivka lives and becomes... her new personal guardian. The girl is, of course, shocked. However, this is just the beginning of incredible adventures that make her doubt almost everything she knows about humanity.",
